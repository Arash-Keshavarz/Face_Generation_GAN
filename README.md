# Generation of Fake Celebrity Faces
## Project Overview

This project focuses on generating realistic new images using the CelebA dataset. Our goal is to create synthetic faces that closely resemble actual celebrities, utilizing modern GANs architectures.

## Image Example
Below is an example of the original faces from the CelebA dataset:
